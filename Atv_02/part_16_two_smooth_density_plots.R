# Instructions
# Now we are going to make density plots for males and females separately. 
# We can do this using the group argument within the aes mapping. 
# Because each point will be assigned to a different density depending on a variable from the dataset, 
# we need to map within aes.

# Instructions
# Create separate smooth density plots for males and females by defining group by sex. 
# Use the existing aes function inside of the ggplot function.
